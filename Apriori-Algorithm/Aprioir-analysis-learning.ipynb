    "\n",
    "### **2. Apply Threshold-Based Categorization**\n",

    "### **3. Generate Transactions**\n",
    "- Each row in the dataset is converted into a transaction, representing a set of categorized attributes.\n",

    "### **4. Generate C1**\n",
    "- For each transaction, the code counts the number of times each item appears across all transactions.\n",
    "- The result is a dictionary (`C1`) where:\n",
    "  - **Key**: Item (e.g., `\"Turns_20-40\"`, `\"Winner_White\"`)\n",

    "\n",
    "## **What is Pruning in Apriori?**\n",
    "Pruning is the process of eliminating infrequent itemsets from the candidate set (**C**) to generate the frequent itemset (**L**). This step ensures that only itemsets meeting the minimum support threshold are carried forward in the Apriori analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How It Works**\n",
    "1. **Candidate Set (C)**:\n",
    "   - Generated in each iteration of Apriori, containing potential itemsets of increasing size (e.g., **C1**, **C2**, **C3**).\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Frequent Itemset (L)**:\n",
    "   - Derived from **C** by filtering itemsets based on the **minimum support threshold**.\n",
    "   - Itemsets with support counts below the threshold are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Relation to the Apriori Property**:\n",
    "   - **Apriori Property**:\n",
    "     - \"If an itemset is not frequent, then all its supersets cannot be frequent.\"\n",
    "   - Pruning leverages this property to reduce the search space by focusing only on frequent itemsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why is it Called Pruning?**\n",
    "- **Pruning** refers to removing unnecessary parts (infrequent itemsets) and focusing on the meaningful core (frequent itemsets).\n",
    "- By eliminating infrequent itemsets, pruning ensures computational efficiency and avoids generating irrelevant candidates in subsequent iterations.\n",
    "\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Why is Pruning Important?**\n",
    "1. **Focuses on Relevant Patterns**:\n",
    "   - Eliminates infrequent itemsets that cannot contribute to meaningful rules or insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduces Computational Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Limits the size of subsequent candidate sets by removing unnecessary combinations.\n",

    "## Step II: Generate L1 (Filtered Itemset with Support Counts â‰¥ Minimum Support)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective:\n",
    "Filter the candidate set (`C1`) by removing items with support counts below a specified minimum support threshold. The resulting filtered itemset is called `L1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How the Code Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input**:\n",
    "   - Takes the `C1` candidate set generated in Step I, which contains items and their support counts.\n",
    "   - A predefined minimum support threshold (`min_support`) is set. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     min_support = 3000\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filtering Logic**:\n",
    "   - Each item in `C1` is compared against the `min_support` threshold.\n",
    "   - If an item's support count is greater than or equal to `min_support`, it is retained in the filtered set `L1`.\n",
    "   - Items that do not meet this condition are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output**:\n",
    "   - The filtered set `L1`, containing items and their support counts, is stored as a dictionary.\n",
    "   - This dictionary is converted to a `pandas.DataFrame` for tabular display.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualization**:\n",
    "   - The resulting `L1` is displayed as an HTML table for better readability in a Jupyter Notebook environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Dataset Characteristics**:\n",

    "   - All frequent 3-itemsets involve `Opening Ply_<=5`, suggesting that games with fewer opening moves (indicating shorter openings) strongly correlate with other game attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Victory Status Resign**:\n",
    "   - The itemsets containing `Victory Status_resign` have notably high support counts:\n",
    "     - For `Winner_white`, the support is **3781**.\n",
    "     - For `Winner_black`, the support is **3456**.\n",
    "   - This indicates that resignation is a common outcome, regardless of the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Turns_60+ Correlations**:\n",
    "   - Itemsets involving games with `Turns_60+` appear frequently with:\n",
    "     - `Winner_white`: **2725 occurrences**.\n",
    "     - `Winner_black`: **2691 occurrences**.\n",
    "     - `Victory Status_resign`: **2548 occurrences**.\n",
    "   - This suggests that longer games often end with resignations and victories for either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Victory Status Mate**:\n",
    "   - The presence of `Victory Status_mate` correlates with `Opening Ply_<=5` and other attributes:\n",
    "     - `Winner_white`: **2368 occurrences**.\n",
    "     - `Turns_60+`: **2176 occurrences**.\n",
    "   - These patterns may indicate successful mate strategies in longer games with shorter openings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Turns_40-60**:\n",
    "   - The frequent 3-itemset `Opening Ply_<=5 & Turns_40-60 & Victory Status_resign` occurs **2013 times**, suggesting that medium-length games also often end in resignation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "The Apriori analysis highlights significant patterns in the chess dataset:\n",
    "- **Opening Ply_<=5**: Short openings dominate frequent patterns, influencing outcomes and game lengths.\n",
    "- **Victory Status_resign**: Resignation is a common conclusion, especially in longer games.\n",
    "- **Turns_60+**: Longer games exhibit strong correlations with resignation and victory for both players.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since **C4 is empty**, the analysis stops here. The identified 3-itemsets (**L3**) are the most complex frequent patterns, providing actionable insights for chess game analysis.\n"
